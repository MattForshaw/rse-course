# # Refactoring Trees: An exercise in Research Software Engineering

# In this exercise, you will convert badly written code, provided here, into better-written code.

# You will do this not through simply writing better code, but by taking a refactoring approach, as discussed in the lectures.

# As such, your use of `git` version control, to make a commit after each step of the refactoring, with a commit message which indicates the refactoring you took, will be critical to success.
# 

# You will also be asked to look at the performance of your code, and to make changes which improve the speed of the code.

# The script as supplied has its parameters hand-coded within the code. You will be expected, in your refactoring, to make these available as command line parameters to be supplied when the code is invoked.

# # Some terrible code

# Here's our terrible code:

# In[1]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# In[2]:


from math import sin, cos
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

s = 1
d = [[0, 1, 0]]
plt.plot([0, 0], [0, 1])
for i in range(5):
    n = []
    for j in range(len(d)):
        n.append(
            [
                d[j][0] + s * sin(d[j][2] - 0.2),
                d[j][1] + s * cos(d[j][2] - 0.2),
                d[j][2] - 0.2,
            ]
        )
        n.append(
            [
                d[j][0] + s * sin(d[j][2] + 0.2),
                d[j][1] + s * cos(d[j][2] + 0.2),
                d[j][2] + 0.2,
            ]
        )
        plt.plot([d[j][0], n[-2][0]], [d[j][1], n[-2][1]])
        plt.plot([d[j][0], n[-1][0]], [d[j][1], n[-1][1]])
    d = n
    s *= 0.6
plt.savefig("tree.png")


# # Suggested Marking Scheme
# If you want to self-assess your solution you can consider using the marking scheme below.

# ## Part one: Refactoring (15 marks)

# * Copy the code above into a file tree.py, invoke it with python tree.py, and verify it creates an image tree.png which looks like that above.
# * Initialise your git repository with the raw state of the code. (**1 mark**)
# * Identify a number of simple refactorings which can be used to improve the code, *reducing repetition* and *improving readability*. Implement these one by one, with a git commit each time.
#     * **1 mark** for each refactoring, **1 mark** for each git commit, at least five such: **10 marks total**.
# * Do NOT introduce NumPy or other performance improvements yet (see below.)
# * Identify which variables in the code would, more sensibly, be able to be input parameters, and use Argparse to manage these.
#    * **4 marks**: 1 for each of four arguments identified.

# ##Â Part two: performance programming (10 marks)

# * For the code as refactored, prepare a figure which plots the time to produce the tree, versus number of iteration steps completed. Your code to produce this figure should run as a script, which you should call `perf_plot.py`, invoking a function imported from `tree.py`. The script should produce a figure called `perf_plot.png`. Comment on your findings in a text file, called `comments.md`. For your performance measurements you should turn off the actual plotting, and run only the mathematical calculation using an appropriate flag. **5 marks**:
#    * Time to run code identified. (**1 mark**)
#    * Figure created. (**1 mark**)
#    * Figure correctly formatted. (**1 mark**)
#    * Figure auto-generated from script. (**1 mark**)
#    * Performance law identified. (**1 mark**)

# * The code above makes use of `append()` which is not appropriate for `NumPy`. Create a new solution (in a file called `tree_np.py`) which makes use of `NumPy`. Compare the performance (again, excluding the plotting from your measurements), and discuss in comments.md. **5 marks**:
#     * Array-operations used to subtract the change angle from all angles in a single minus sign. (**1 mark**)
#     * Array-operations used to take the sine of all angles using np.sin. (**1 mark**)
#     * Array-operations used to move on all the positions with a single vector displacement addition. (**1 mark**)
#     * Numpy solution uses `hstack` or similar to create new arrays with twice the length, by composing the left-turned array with the right-turned array. (**1 mark**)
#     * Performance comparison recorded. (**1 mark**)
